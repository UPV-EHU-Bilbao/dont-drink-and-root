# Mastodon API FX client.

In this project we create an application with several functionalities on the Mastodon social network.

For the first sprint of the project we have implemented the following usages:

    1) View User Toots: The toots published or boosted by a certain user are shown.
    2) View Followers: Given a user, the app will show its followers and their corresponding information.
    3) View Following: Given a user, the app will show the account that he/she is following and their corresponding information.

Second sprint:

First of all, we have corrected some of the issues from the previous sprint:

    - Using asynchronous calls now.
    - Scrolling over users is fluent.
    - The domain model has been corrected.
    - Improvement of the scene looking.
    
 And these are the new functionalities added to the project:
 
    1) When loading the app, it is necessary either to login or to select a logged account to enter with.
    2) It is now possible to post a toot.
    3) Manage favourites.
    
 Third sprint:
 
 As in the previous sprint, we have corrected the founded issues:
 
    - The app freezed in several cases. Not a problem anymore.
    - The login view wasn't intuitive. We have improved the scene looking and added the possibility to manage several accounts from that window.
    - The like button has been improved.
    
 These are the new features that we have added:
 
    1) The homepage is now available, so you can now see the toots published by the accounts that you follow.
    2) You can now schedule a toot, instead of posting it inmediately.
    
 Some other tasks like creating several branches and testing with JUnit have been done.
